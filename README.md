# Project Overview

Front End for TravelBase, a full stack MERN app for planning your next trip! 

## Project Description

This app utilizes ReactJS ([Frontend Repo](https://github.com/nprasad2077/front-end-travel-app)) along with MongoDB, NodeJS, and Express ([Backend Repo](https://github.com/nprasad2077/back-end-travel-app)) on the backend to help users explore cities around the world! Users can browse popular cities for travels and find things to do in the city, or add a city and places they would like to visit.
