# Presentations

**Each member of the group** must participate in the presentation.

Each presentation will be at most ten minutes long. We recommend that you plan
your presentation ahead of time and practice running through it at least once.
Five minutes will then be allotted for questions from the class. Take turns
answering questions during the Q & A. We suggest the following structure:

## Introduction

- What's your app called?
- Who are your group members? Who had which responsibilities?
- Why is it useful? What is your "pitch"?

## Demonstrating Your App

- What are the integral features of your app?

## Demonstrating Your Code

- What was the most difficult part?
- What did you learn?
- What are you most proud of?

## The Planning Process

- How did you arrive at this idea?
- How did you decide who would have which responsibilities?
- What would you change about your planning process?

## The Workflow

- What
